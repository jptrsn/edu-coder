I'm a full-stack software developer with a decade of web development experience. I love building beautiful, responsive web apps that are a pleasure to use.

As a former teacher, I'm passionate about using technology to empower learners to seek, find and use information to improve learning. I am an advocate for free and open technology, and I believe that community-building is the true power of the internet.

I believe that knowledge should be shared freely and accessibly, and that people are more important that profits. I write and publish a lot of code, some of it is even good.

I love solving problems, brainstorming new ideas, features, and approaches, learning new coding languages, techniques, and architectures. One of my greatest strengths is in coordinating a group of people who enjoy 

When I'm not working, I spend my free time tinkering with hobby electronics in the smart home area of interest, usually involving 3D printing and lots of blinking lights.
