# What is open?

Something I'm passionate about is the concept of "openness" on the internet. It can be somewhat subjectively defined, but let me try to put into precise words what it means to me:

> Openness can be characterized as a willingness to share ideas, as well as a willingness to have those ideas challenged. It is an embodyment of a community-focused collective effort.

You can have an open mind, you can have an open source software project, you can have an open-book test.

# Why does it matter?



# Who benefits?

# Is it sustainable?

# What are the obstacles?

# How do we get there?
